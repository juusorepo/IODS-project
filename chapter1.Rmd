*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R Markdown syntax.*

## Feeling at the beginning

I feel quite *excited* about the course. I am new to R and a lot of other stuff in the course. Will definitely learn a lot!
